# Josh's Useful Linux Shit

This repo contains useful linux stuff such as installation scripts and my `.bashrc`.

## Usage

To set up a new linux computer clone this repo, `cd` into it run:
```bash
sudo chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh <surface>
```

* `<surface> = surface | <leave empty>` is whether to install the [Jakeday Kernel](https://github.com/jakeday/linux-surface) Patch for the Surface series of computers.

## Notes: 
* Not been properly tested so might break.

## To Do
* Move long .bashrc stuff to a bash file. [Tutorial](https://medium.com/devnetwork/how-to-create-your-own-custom-terminal-commands-c5008782a78e).
* Add set up for vscode extensions ([something similar to this](https://www.peerlator.com/blog/MyDotfilesPart5/)).
